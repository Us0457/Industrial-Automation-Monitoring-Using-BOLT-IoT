# Industrial-Automation-Monitoring-Using-BOLT-IoT
This project model explains the use of IoT system for any processing plant whose Boiler temperature are a major concern, which means it has high-temperature control demands. So, We need to control it as well deploying a system for worker safety also.
Pharmaceutical industry boilers are a critical component of any processing plant. Boilers used in the pharma industry must be extremely precise, which means it has high-temperature control demands. And it is necessary to maintain the temperature levels within a certain limit, which is mandated by the end-use application.

And second thing is that an SMS should be sent to the Deputy Plant manager when a worker wants to enter the Boiler room and only allow access to the worker if the Plant manager approves of it.
